            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Request to Allow Late Payment of Fees</p>
            <p>Respected Sir/Madam,</p>
            <p>I, <strong>Mali Mahendrakumar Rameshbhai</strong>, a student of <strong>MCA, Semester 1</strong>, Roll Number <strong>14</strong>, kindly request your permission to pay my fees by next <strong>Tuesday</strong>.</p>
            <p>When I took admission, the <strong>Admission Department</strong> assured me that I would get a job based on my coding skills. I believed this and thought I could use the job income to pay my fees. However, no job has been provided so far. I even had other admission options but chose this college because of the job assurance.</p>
            <p>The teaching has also been difficult for me to follow, with frequent changes in teachers and more focus on theory than practicals. This has made it harder to manage my studies and fees.</p>
            <p>I have spoken to my father, and he has promised to arrange the payment by next Tuesday. I kindly request you to allow me time until then. Please also ensure that my university form is not held back because of this delay.</p>
            <p>If there is any way you can provide the job as promised, it would help me pay my fees sooner and reduce my stress.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your support.</p>
